**Geoff Boeing Presentation to Urban Planners**

Part of me was shocked by how new OSMnx was pretty new. As part of the GenZ demographic cohort, I tend to assume most information is a Google search away and conveniently comprehensible. In this presentation, Dr. Boeing's main point is that when you are matters for spatial data science of networks. He poses the question of what did planners do? So similar to Ananya Roy's class we're looking at the conjecture of who did what and where. I really enjoyed this presentation and wish I had been there last quarter! Some thoughts I had while listening to the questions section included:

Most people take infrastructure for granted until something goes wrong, like a disaster.
Dense grids have more options for network resilience.
Dr. Boeing is pretty young... He knows what memes are. 
I really admire how he pieced this together and considers OSMnx a process.
The future is that most industries will need coding skills. 
This is the first time I've ever heard the term "Zoom Vaccum"
