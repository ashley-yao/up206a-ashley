Hi! My name is Ashley Yao. I am a first year Master of Urban and Regional Planning Student at UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. I'm an older sister and dabble in a lot of hobbies. Currently, I am learning guitar and trying out new video games! 

UP206: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science is a course exploring the foundations of spatial data science. Spatial data science is the method of extracting knowledge from data to look at where things happen and why. This course does this by teaching Python. 

My objective for taking this class is to expand my skill set in data processing with a focus on future work in research and transportation!
