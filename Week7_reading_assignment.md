**Parking search caused congestion: Whereâ€™s all the fuss?**

This article was so interesting and I would love to do work on this subject matter. From what I understood is that this paper simply looks to consolidate information regarding "cruising" terminology. This is done through an investigation of what should count as cruising and how often cruising is observable. The authors define cruising as the following: (i) that the actual path is at least 200 m greater than the shortest path, or (ii) that at least one block is traversed more than once (a subset of the trips identified by the first definition). Connecting back to the previous readings, rather than being time based, this question seemed place based. I think it would be useful to replicate this information for other cities. I was also really fascinated by the collection of data using smartphone GPS because I had a friend use a similar technology with smartphone bluetooth to track transit ridership. Another highlight I noted was how travel time cruising was more valued. This is probably because of the indefinite nature and how one would already be at the destination. To that extend are our cars objects of burden? Lastly, I have recently been thinking a lot about driver intent and behavior. I appreciated how the authors went into discrepencies between preferred paths versus search radius/actual paths of drivers. Based on the results, I think that driver behavior is specific to each location. This overall trend would be difficult to track as general knowledge, but could be very useful for local regions, so I do think it should be replicated for most cities as descriptive data to help with design processes.
