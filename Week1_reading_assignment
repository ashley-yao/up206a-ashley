Tehnology today allows us to track and correlate people with locations to a near impractical point. Big data has critical ramifications for how we procure, produce, and use spatial data. Geospatial big data analytics have been impactful in humanitarian work and emerging technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Utilizing data can streamline processes. UAVs have been successful in gathering data from the air that is valuable to many sectors. 

For starters, the article seems to speak mostly from a business perspective of utilizing geospatial information and big data. The examples provided in the text seem to be exceptional uses rather than conventional. Although the truck maintenance example for efficiency use seemed pretty typical, I anticipated reading something about how chain businesses utilize spatial data to locate their stores. This article spoke to me in my approach to data and research through its discourse in UAVs. UAVs can be utilized in many sectors such as agriculture, finance, engineering, etc. Exploring applications of UAV to planning would be something I would like to explore, especially in the development of transportation infrastucture and our built environment. Big data and geospatial information inform my goals of visualizing and impacting travel behavior and human migration.
